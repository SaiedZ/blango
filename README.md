# Advanced Django: Mastering Django and Django Rest Framework Specialization


## Overview

I have taken this specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/codio-advanced-django-and-django-rest-framework) to master Django and the Django Rest Framework. 
During four courses, I have created a blog an an accompanying API using industry-standard tools and software packages without installing anything!

## What I have learned

- Optimize performance through caching and optimizing database operations
- Authenticate users with Google
- Build an API with Django Rest Framework
